I am a multidisciplinary researcher specializing in data science, economics and public policy. 
I currently work as a data analyst for the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania. At PWBM, I contribute to the organizationâ€™s work on simulating the 
impacts of various policy measures on the United States (U.S.) economy through microsimulation models. 
In particular, my work focuses on the applications of machine learning in economic modelling and 
policy research. 

Prior to this, I completed a master's degree in Data Analytics and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon
University, a master's in economics from the Delhi School of Economics and a bachelor's degree in economics 
from the University of Delhi.
